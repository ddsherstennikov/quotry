# This file contains the WSGI configuration required to serve up your
# web application at http://www.quotry.com/
# It works by setting the variable 'application' to a WSGI handler of some
# description.
#
# Below are templates for Django and Flask.  You should update the file
# appropriately for the web framework you're using, and then
# click the 'Reload /yourdomain.com/' button on the 'Web' tab to make your site
# live.

# +++++++++++ VIRTUALENV +++++++++++
# If you're using a virtualenv, you should activate it at the top of your
# wsgi file, using code like this:
#
#activate_this_path = '/home/sdd/path/to/my-virtualenv/bin/activate_this.py'
#with open(activate_this_path) as f:
#    code = compile(f.read(), activate_this_path, 'exec')
#exec(code, dict(__file__=activate_this_path))



# +++++++++++ CUSTOM WSGI +++++++++++
# If you have a WSGI file that you want to serve using PythonAnywhere, perhaps
# in your home directory under version control, then use something like this:
#
#import os
#import sys
#
#path = '/home/sdd/path/to/my/app
#if path not in sys.path:
#    sys.path.append(path)
#
#from my_wsgi_file import application


# +++++++++++ DJANGO +++++++++++
# To use your own django app use code like this:
#import os
#import sys
#
## assuming your django settings file is at '/home/sdd/mysite/settings.py'
#path = '/home/sdd'
#if path not in sys.path:
#    sys.path.append(path)
#
#os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'
#
#import django.core.handlers.wsgi
#application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()


# +++++++++++ FLASK +++++++++++
# Here is a simple Flask app. It is currently serving the default welcome
# page.  You can adapt this if you want.
#
# If you're using a different web framework, you'll need to comment all of this
# out

from flask import Flask
